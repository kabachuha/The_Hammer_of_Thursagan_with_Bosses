Pretty much the same campaign you all used to... Wait, is that a Mechanical Goliath?!

Original premise:
In the first years of the Northern Alliance, an expedition from Knalga seeks out their kin at Kal Kartha and to learn the fate of the legendary Hammer of Thursagan. The perils of their journey through the wild Northern Lands, though great, pale beside the evil they will face at its end.

(Upper-intermediate level, 11 scenarios.)

Fight the overpowerered enemies with overpowerered allies, overcome the overwhelming boss battles and expect the nastiest things at the most unexpected moments.

Plot and dialogue is mostly unchanged, you can play this campaign if you haven't played the original one, but expect deviations from the mainline lore. Translations for the most part of the campaign are used from the mainline.

Heavily influenced by the addon “Invasion from the Unknown”.

Music addons “Invasion from the Unknown Music” and “After the Storm Music” are recommended (but not required) for a better atmosphere of epicness.

Have fun! ☺
